# barnard59-server

## Usage

### Client

A static bundle can be generated by running the npm script

```
npm run build
```

There is also a `dev` script which runs webpack in dev and watch mode.

```
npm run dev
```

### Server

Server can be started directly from shell with:

```
node server.js
```

## Examples

As there is no create new pipeline feature in the UI yet, you have to upload it.
The script in the examples folder can do this for you:

```
node examples/create-pipeline-and-job.js
```
